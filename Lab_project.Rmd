`5. (2 points)
```{r}
library(dplyr)

  arrange(animal_name)

# Display the result
print(pigs)

```




`6. (2 points)

  filter(species == "Goat") %>%
  select(animal_name, primary_breed) %>%
  arrange(animal_name)

# Display the result
print(goats)

```





`7. (2 points)
```{r}
# Concatenate the two columns animal_name and species into a single column named pet
# then display license_number and pet sorted by pet
pets <- seattlepets %>%
  mutate(pet = paste(animal_name, species, sep = "; ")) %>%
  select(license_number, pet) %>%
  arrange(pet)

# Display the result
print(pets)

```



`8. (2 points)
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Plot the counts of the species as bars
ggplot(seattlepets, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Counts of Pet Species in Seattle", x = "Species", y = "Count")

```




`9. (2 points)
```{r}
top_10_names <- seattlepets %>% 
filter(animal_name %in% c( "Lucy"  , "Charlie" , "Luna" , "Bella" , "Max"    , 
                           "Daisy" , "Molly"   , "Jack" , "Lily"  , "Stella" ))
top_10_names
```
`a.	What does the above code chunk do?
Filter the Dataset: It filters the seattlepets dataset to include only rows where the animal_name column matches one of the specified names in the list: "Lucy", "Charlie", "Luna", "Bella", "Max", "Daisy", "Molly", "Jack", "Lily", and "Stella".
Assign the Result to top_10_names: The filtered dataset is then stored in a new variable called top_10_names.
Display the Result: It displays the contents of top_10_names to show the filtered data


`b. Plot the counts of the pet names (animal_name) in top_10_names
```{r}
ggplot(top_10_names, aes(x = animal_name, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Pet Names in Seattle Segmented by Species", 
       x = "Pet Name", 
       y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

`The below code plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the x = y line; if a name appeared on this line, the nameâ€™s popularity would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

`What names are more common for cats than dogs? The ones above the line or the ones below the line?

`Answer here.The names that are more common for cats than dogs are the ones above the line. This is because the y-axis represents the proportion of dogs and the x-axis represents the proportion of cats. Points above the line 
y=x indicate that the proportion for cats is higher than for dogs.



`Is the relationship between the two variables (proportion of cats with a given name and proportion of dogs with a given name) positive or negative? What does this mean in context of the data?

`Answer here 
The relationship between the two variables (proportion of cats with a given name and proportion of dogs with a given name) is positive. This means that, generally, if a name is popular among cats, it also tends to be popular among dogs. The points are scattered around the line 

y=x, indicating that the same names are often used for both cats and dogs, with varying degrees of popularity.
